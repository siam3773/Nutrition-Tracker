 Our Project is a Nutrition tracker. We have made software that    enables individuals to  track their foodâ€™s nutritional information. This project aims to utilize Python programming language to create a user-friendly and interactive platform for accessing nutritional data.We have created an app that allows Users to search for a specific food, view detailed nutritional information, compare the nutritional profiles of 2 food items side by side and Display a sorted list of foods based on the nutrient with the highest value
The app uses an API that we have created to gather data on different foods, (such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats), micronutrients, vitamins, minerals, and calories. 
The user interface is designed using Python's GUI framework Tkinter providing an intuitive and visually appealing experience.
